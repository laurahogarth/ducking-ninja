We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.
I had more, but you go ahead. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?
Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Come, Comrade Bender!
We must take to the streets!
Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.
Hey, whatcha watching?
Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.
When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.
Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?
Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
Fatal. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. It's a T. It goes 'tuh'.
Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Ugh, it's filthy! 
Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! 
This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Oh, but you can. 
But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.
Why did you bring us here? Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. 
We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! 
Say it in Russian! 
And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? 
It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?
